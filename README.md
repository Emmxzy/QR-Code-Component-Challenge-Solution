## My Process  

### Built With  

- **Semantic HTML5** for structure.  
- **Modern CSS** for styling and layout.  
- **Flexbox** for alignment and spacing.  
- **Mobile-first approach** for responsive design.  

### What I Learned  

This project helped me:  
1. **Master Flexbox:** I became more comfortable using flexbox for layout design, particularly for centering elements vertically and horizontally.  
2. **Responsive Design:** I applied media queries to ensure the design works well on both mobile and desktop devices.  
3. **Design Refinement:** I focused on small design details like padding, font sizes, and color schemes to ensure the component matches the provided mockup.  
4. **Using ChatGPT for Guidance:** I overcame roadblocks, like spacing and alignment issues, by seeking tailored advice from ChatGPT.  

### Continued Development  

In future projects, I plan to:  
- Experiment with **CSS Grid** for more complex layouts.  
- Focus more on **accessibility** by testing designs with screen readers.  
- Incorporate animations or transitions to enhance interactivity.
